## Phone Number To List of Text Strings
This was an interview question years ago.  To write code that takes a phone number and finds all of the possible strings using the number's corresponding letters (For Example 2 => "a,b,c").  This example is to share C# Code as well work to do a recursive and non-recursive methods.

## Activity Manager
Task Activity Manager that had a web interface for assigning out task to 1 or many individuals.  Or you could assign a task to a group that individuals would receive.  
### SQL - Recurring activities
The SQL code snippets showcase how a recurrence task is created.  When a recuring task is created it creates virtual tasks which refer back to the original task.  This allows for changes to occur without managing all of the recurring task in the future.  Once a virtual task is updated, for example "it is marked completed" it hydrates a task so it can be tracked on its own.  
### Integration Test
The following is integration test, sharing this code makes me feel a bit vulnerable on code style - It was created 7 years ago to test a platform.  But I wanted to share as it shows multiple things without actually sharing source implementation code of the product.  In addition this shows the importance of test automation, there were a handful of times where code changed and test failed due to an edge case not caught. I strongly believe Integration and Unit Tests are "Musts" for any solution/project. 
1. JWT Bearer Tokens - Authenticating and authorizing a user through tokens.
2. JSON Creation - There is both using Text String but also using JObject and JArray to populate a submission request
3. Voice Tasks, Audio File Dictation - Yes the application allowed a user to message via audio, it would use Azure Cognitive services to dictate the audio into text.  This required a call check if the task was completed before it tested successfully.
